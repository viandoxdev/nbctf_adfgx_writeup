        <h1>ADFGX Master &ndash; Cryptanalysis <span class="c_red">(500pts)</span></h1>

        For this last cryptography challenge, we're given two files:
        <ul>
            <li> <span class="c_prim w_bold">output.txt</span> &ndash; a large encrypted text file</li>
            <li> <span class="c_prim w_bold">ADFGX_cryptosystem.py</span> &ndash; the python script used to encrypt the
                message</li>
        </ul>

        We are told the format of the flag: <span class="w_bold c_green">NBCTF{<span
                class="w_reg">HIDDEN_MESSAGE</span>}</span>, where the hidden message is found by decrypting
        output.txt. <br />

        <h2> What are we working with ? </h2>

        Lets first take a quick look at output.txt to get a feel of what's inside, and the format it comes in:

        <pre class="nohighlight"><code
                class="nohighlight">GADGDXFDDXDGGAGDADDDDAGXXGGAFXXDAFADFXGDGAAFXFGGGAXFAXGDGGADGADAGDDDGXDAGFXDXGDDGDXFDGAAGDFAGGGADDADXGXGGDAGDXXGDDXGDFGFXGGGXXGGDGGXDGDADDAFDGADFDDGADGGDADDAGXGXGDAFXXFXDDDGDADDFGXXAFDXDDGXGGDDGFGDADDGFGDXDGGFAXXXAAGXGDDXDDGDAFDGADFFFGXDFGDFDGFGGGDDAXFAGDXXGXFFFGDGDXXDFDDGDGGGGFAFDDGAAXGADDGXDXGXGDDXDGDDAXFXAFDGAXDFFGDXDXXGXAGFAXDFDGDGDGGFFXXDXAGGGXDGDFAGGFGXAGGGDGDXGDDDGXDXGXDFFADDAXDDGFGAGGGDAGAGGGXGDXGXDGDXGDDDFGGDGADGGGAAGGDAGDGAXGGFGDFGDDAXGGDDGGGXGXADGXDGXFXXXDXFGDDXXDGGGDFDAXDFDDFXXXDDGGA...</code></pre>

        We pick up on a few things:
        <ul>
            <li>The only letter used are A, D, F, G and X</li>
            <li>No other characters are used (spaces, newlines, braces, ...)</li>
            <li>The file is weirdly large, I've only put a sample here but the real file is a 21000 characters.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> The ADFGX crypto system </h2>

        Now that we have an idea of the encrypted message's format, lets look at the encryption algorithm.

        <div class="note">
            I've omitted the code for part1 and part2 for clarity, and rewrote / added some comments
        </div>

        <pre><code class="language-python">import re
from secret import substitution_matrix

letters = ["A", "D", "F", "G", "X"]

def part1(plaintext):
    # ...

def part2(pre_ciphertext):
    # ...

# Get the clear text message
text = open("lettre_confidentiel.txt").read()
# Remove all characters that aren't in A-V or X-Z (lower and upper)
p = re.compile('[A-VX-Z]')
plaintext = "".join(p.findall(text.upper()))
# encrypt in two steps:
## Character substitution
pre_ciphertext = part1(plaintext)
## Column reordering
ciphertext = part2(pre_ciphertext)
# Print and write the encrypted message
print(ciphertext)
f = open("output.txt", "w")
f.write(ciphertext)
        </code></pre>

        Skimming over <code>part1</code> and <code>part2</code> the program is relatively simple, some characters are
        eliminated (the ones that can't be processed by the system), and the encryption is performed in two steps, in
        our case we'll need to first reverse <code>part2</code> and then <code>part1</code> to get the clear output.

        <h2> Reversing <code>part2</code></h2>

        The code for part2 is as such:

        <pre><code class="language-python">def part2(pre_ciphertext):
    key = "nobracket"

    ## Index of the key in alphabetic order
    n = len(key)
    key_index = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: key[i])

    ## Padding to make sure the size of pre_ciphertext
    ## is a multiple of the key's
    while len(pre_ciphertext)%n != 0:
        pre_ciphertext = pre_ciphertext + "X"

    ## Column reordering

    # permutation
    ciphertext = ""
    for i in range(len(pre_ciphertext)//n):
        for j in key_index:
            ciphertext = ciphertext + pre_ciphertext[i*n + j]

    # transposition
    true_cipher = ""
    for i in range(n):
        for j, c in enumerate(ciphertext):
            if j%n == i :
                true_cipher = true_cipher + c

    return true_cipher
        </code></pre>

        <code>part2</code> is made up of two major steps that I will call permutation and transposition. There is also a
        padding step before that, but this is irreversible as there is no way to know if the characters are padding or
        actually part of the message from the encrypted text alone. Luckily this doesn't matter much.

        <h3> Transposition </h3>

        Here is the code:

        <pre><code class="language-python">true_cipher = ""
for i in range(n): # outer
    for j, c in enumerate(ciphertext): # inner
        if j%n == i :
            true_cipher = true_cipher + c
        </code></pre>

        Lets start from the inner loop, we iterate over all the characters in <code>ciphertext</code> (along with their
        indices j), filter some out and append the rest to <code>true_cipher</code>. To understand the <code>j %
            n</code> part, we can imagine splitting the cipher text into many chunks of length n, we then only keep the
        elements which are the i<sup>th</sup> of their respective chunks:

        <div id="vis_transpose" class="vis clickable">
            <div class="meta_line">
                <div class="iter">n = </div>
                <div class="middle">ciphertext</div>
                <div class="info"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="line_1 line"></div>
            <div class="meta_line">
                true_cipher
            </div>
            <div class="line_2 line"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
            If we interpret the ciphertext as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order">row
                major</a> matrix (with rows of length n), this code effectively computes the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose">transpose</a> of this matrix, hence the name.
            <br />
            <br />
            As taking the transpose of the transpose of a matrix does nothing, the code to reverse the transposition
            would be the same as the one doing transposition with <code>n</code> replaced with <code>len(ciphertext) //
                n</code> (the transposed matrix's width).
        </div>

        Now that we have a good understanding of the process, we can start writing our <code>reverse_part2</code>
        function:

        <pre><code class="language-python">def reverse_part2(true_cipher):
    key = "nobracket"
    n = len(key)

    ciphertext = ""
    # number of chunks of length n in ciphertext
    m = len(true_cipher) // n
    # reconstruct each chunk one by one
    for i in range(m):
        # if ciphertext contained [a0, a1, a2, ..., b0, b1, b2, ...]
        #                    (i = 1)  0   1   2
        # then true_cipher contains [a0, b0, c0, ..., a1, b1, c1, ...]
        #                                 └─────── m ──────┘
        # So we start from i and skip m to get to the next one in the
        # chunk and do that for each chunk (the outer for)
        for j in range(i, len(true_cipher), m):
            ciphertext = ciphertext + true_cipher[j]
            </code></pre>

        <h3> Permutation </h3>

        At this point we are done with half of <code>part2</code> and we just need to reverse the permutation step
        before we can move on to <code>part1</code>. Here is the code:

        <pre><code class="language-python"># setup
key = "nobracket"
n = len(key)
key_index = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: key[i])

# permutation
ciphertext = ""
for i in range(len(pre_ciphertext)//n):
    for j in key_index:
        # index of the first character in the chunk ┐
        ciphertext = ciphertext + pre_ciphertext[(i * n) + j]
        #                              offset in the chunk ┘
            </code></pre>

        First the setup: most of it is around computing <code>key_index</code>, which is just a reordered
        <code>range(n)</code>. Then the loops, we again imagine splitting our input in consecutive chunks of length n,
        and iterate over the index i of each chunk. The inner loop simply adds all the characters of the chunk to
        ciphertext in the order prescribed by <code>key_index</code>. Effectively this permutates, or reorders the
        characters in every chunk.

        <div id="vis_permute" class="vis clickable">
            <div class="label">key index</div>
            <div class="cells cells_key_index"></div>
            <div class="label">chunk</div>
            <div class="cells cells_chunk"></div>
            <div class="label">reordered</div>
            <div class="cells cells_result"></div>
            <div class="label">key index reverse</div>
            <div class="cells cells_key_index_reverse"></div>
            <div class="label">reversed</div>
            <div class="cells cells_reversed"></div>
        </div>

        We can now reverse this and finish our <code>reverse_part2</code> function:
        <pre><code class="language-python">def reverse_part2(true_cipher):
    key = "nobracket"
    n = len(key)
    # key_index = [4, 2, 5, 7, 6, 0, 1, 3, 8] this means each reordered
    # chunk will have, in order, the 5th, 3rd, 6th, 8th, ..., characters.
    key_index = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: key[i])
    # compute the reverse permutation in the same way
    # this verrifies: key_index[key_index_reverse[i]] == i
    # key_index_reverse = [5, 6, 1, 7, 0, 2, 4, 3, 8]
    key_index_reverse = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: key_index[i])

    # reverse transposition
    ciphertext = ""
    # number of chunks of length n in ciphertext
    m = len(true_cipher) // n
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(i, len(true_cipher), m):
            ciphertext = ciphertext + true_cipher[j]

    # reverse permutation
    pre_ciphertext = ""
    for i in range(m):
        for j in key_index_reverse:
            pre_ciphertext = pre_ciphertext + ciphertext[i * n + j]

    return pre_ciphertext

            </code></pre>

        <h3> Testing </h3>

        At this stage we can run a little test to make sure we got it right, this way, if later we have a problem, we'll
        know to only look into <code>reverse_part1</code> since we made sure <code>reverse_part2</code> is right.

        <pre><code class="language-python"># length 18 since we don't reverse padding
test_input = "ADFGXAADDDFFFFXGXAA"
print(reverse_part2(part2(test_input)) == test_input)
            </code></pre>

        If this prints <code>True</code> we know we're good, if it doesn't, we need to debug.

        <h2> Reversing <code>part1</code></h2>

        The code for <code>part1</code> is much shorter and simpler:

        <pre><code class="language-python">def part1(plaintext):
    ## Character substitution

    pre_ciphertext = ""
    for l in plaintext:
        # index // 5 gives the number of 5 elements rows that are before the index
        tmp_row = substitution_matrix.index(l)//5
        # index % 5 gives the offset of the index in a 5 element row
        tmp_col = substitution_matrix.index(l)%5

        pre_ciphertext = pre_ciphertext + letters[tmp_row] + letters[tmp_col]

    return pre_ciphertext
        </code></pre>

        But unfortunatly, this time around simply reversing the code won't suffice, since the crux of the encryption lies in <code>substitution_matrix</code>, which we don't have access to. <br />
    <br />
    For each character:
    <ol>
        <li>We get the index of the character in the substitution matrix.</li>
        <li>We convert that index into a row and column number. This effectively interprets the substitution matrix as a 5x5 row major matrix.</li>
        <li>Convert the column and row number (in the range 0-4) into letters (A, D, F, G and X)</li>
        <li>Add those two characters to the (pre) ciphertext text</li>
    </ol>

    <h3> Going as far as we can go </h3>

    We can at least reverse that before having to actually tackle the problem of getting the substitution matrix:

    <pre><code class="language-python"> def reverse_part1(pre_ciphertext):
    # dict mapping each letter to its value
    letters = { "A": 0, "D": 1, "F": 2, "G": 3, "X": 4 }
    pre_plaintext = [
        # get the original index given by substitution_matrix
        letters[row] * 5 + letters[col] 
        # get every odd indexed elements ──────────┐
        # get every even indexed elements ────┐    │
        for row, col in zip(pre_ciphertext[0::2], pre_ciphertext[1::2])
        #              └────────── get all consecutive pairs ──────────┘
        #                   i.e. "ADFGX" =&gt; ("A", "D"), ("F", "G")
    ]
    </code></pre>

    TODO: Visualization<br /><br />

    <code>pre_plaintext</code> is now a list of numbers between 0 and 24 each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet (without W). The problem now is how do we figure out which number means which letter ?

    <h2> Finding <span class="strike">nemo</span> the substitution matrix </h2>

    When tasked with a search problem like that, the first approach I tend to think of is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">bruteforce</a>. It's plain, simple, and surprisingly works most of the time, and even when it doesn't you can often just improve on it to get a working solution (by reducing the search space for example).<br />
    <br/>
    Unfortunatly for us though, bruteforce isn't really an option here, simple math will reveal that there are 15,511,210,043,330,985,984,000,000 different possible substitution matrices and that even if we could check one per cpu cycle on a relatively fast cpu, the search would still take on average a little more than 60 million years. <br />
    <br />
    Another approach is to simply try some obvious solutions, for example A, B, C, D, ..., Z but simple testing reveals that this isn't going to cut it either.

    <h3> The actual answer </h3>
    
    The real answer lies in an observation we made in the begining: the size of the input message. We know for a fact the flag isn't nearly as long as that, and now that we understand the encryption algorithm, we also know that the encrypted version is twice as long as the clear text one, as such it doesn't make sense for the message to be this long.<br />
    </br >
    On top of that we know the message has to be correct french as we wouldn't have any way of knowing if we decrypted right otherwise. Knowing that, one method we can use of decrypting this kind of substitution encryption is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency">letter frequency</a> (how often does each letter appear in a text).<br />
    <br />
    The frequency of each letter in any large enough text tend to be the same. This is because some of the same words are used many times (a, the, of, ...), and because some letters are just more common (i.e there are way more words with 's' in them than words with 'x'). We can use this to our advantage: we just need to get a sorted list of the 25 most commonly used letters, count the frequency of each index in <code>pre_plaintext</code>, and then match each index to a letter depending on its frequency.

    <pre><code class="language-python"># letters sorted by frequency (in french)
letters_freq = "EAISNRTOLUDCMPGBVHFQYXJKZ"
# count the number of time each index is used in pre_plaintext
index_count = [0] * 25
for i in pre_plaintext:
    index_count[i] += 1

# indices sorted by frequency 
# the first element is the most used index
index_freq = sorted(range(25), # all indices
                    key=lambda i: index_count[i], # order by count
                    reverseTrue) # in decreasing order
# map instead of matrix because we no longer have 2 dimensions
substitution_map = ["_"] * 25 # dummy values
# build the map, freq_rank is the place of the letter/index
# on the list. i.e. 0: E, 1: A, ...
for freq_rank in range(25):
    substitution_map[index_freq[freq_rank]] = letters_freq[freq_rank]

# do substitution
plaintext = ""
for i in pre_plaintext:
    plaintext = plaintext + substitution_map[i]
    </code></pre>

    <h2> Finishing up </h2>
