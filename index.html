        <h1>ADFGX Master &ndash; Cryptanalysis <span class="c_red">(500pts)</span></h1>

        For this last cryptography challenge, we're given two files:
        <ul>
            <li> <span class="c_prim w_bold">output.txt</span> &ndash; a large encrypted text file</li>
            <li> <span class="c_prim w_bold">ADFGX_cryptosystem.py</span> &ndash; the python script used to encrypt the
                message</li>
        </ul>

        We are told the format of the flag: <span class="w_bold c_green">NBCTF{<span
                class="w_reg">HIDDEN_MESSAGE</span>}</span>, where the hidden message is found by decrypting
        output.txt. <br />

        <h2> What are we working with ? </h2>

        Lets first take a quick look at output.txt to get a feel of what's inside, and the format it comes in:

        <pre class="nohighlight"><code
                class="nohighlight">GADGDXFDDXDGGAGDADDDDAGXXGGAFXXDAFADFXGDGAAFXFGGGAXFAXGDGGADGADAGDDDGXDAGFXDXGDDGDXFDGAAGDFAGGGADDADXGXGGDAGDXXGDDXGDFGFXGGGXXGGDGGXDGDADDAFDGADFDDGADGGDADDAGXGXGDAFXXFXDDDGDADDFGXXAFDXDDGXGGDDGFGDADDGFGDXDGGFAXXXAAGXGDDXDDGDAFDGADFFFGXDFGDFDGFGGGDDAXFAGDXXGXFFFGDGDXXDFDDGDGGGGFAFDDGAAXGADDGXDXGXGDDXDGDDAXFXAFDGAXDFFGDXDXXGXAGFAXDFDGDGDGGFFXXDXAGGGXDGDFAGGFGXAGGGDGDXGDDDGXDXGXDFFADDAXDDGFGAGGGDAGAGGGXGDXGXDGDXGDDDFGGDGADGGGAAGGDAGDGAXGGFGDFGDDAXGGDDGGGXGXADGXDGXFXXXDXFGDDXXDGGGDFDAXDFDDFXXXDDGGA...</code>
        </pre>

        We pick up on a few things:
        <ul>
            <li>The only letter used are A, D, F, G and X</li>
            <li>No other characters are used (spaces, newlines, braces, ...)</li>
            <li>The file is weirdly large, I've only put a sample here but the real file is a 21000 characters.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> The ADFGX crypto system </h2>

        Now that we have an idea of the encrypted message's format, lets look at the encryption algorithm.

        <div class="note">
            I've omitted the code for part1 and part2 for clarity, and rewrote / added some comments
        </div>

        <pre><code class="language-python">import re
from secret import substitution_matrix

letters = ["A", "D", "F", "G", "X"]

def part1(plaintext):
    # ...

def part2(pre_ciphertext):
    # ...

# Get the clear text message
text = open("lettre_confidentiel.txt").read()
# Remove all characters that aren't in A-V or X-Z (lower and upper)
p = re.compile('[A-VX-Z]')
plaintext = "".join(p.findall(text.upper()))
# encrypt in two steps:
## Character substitution
pre_ciphertext = part1(plaintext)
## Column reordering
ciphertext = part2(pre_ciphertext)
# Print and write the encrypted message
print(ciphertext)
f = open("output.txt", "w")
f.write(ciphertext)
        </code></pre>

        Skimming over <code>part1</code> and <code>part2</code> the program is relatively simple, some characters are
        eliminated (the ones that can't be processed by the system), and the encryption is performed in two steps, in
        our case we'll need to first reverse <code>part2</code> and then <code>part1</code> to get the clear output.

        <h2> Reversing <code>part2</code> &ndash; column reordering </h2>

        The code for part2 is as such:

        <pre><code class="language-python">def part2(pre_ciphertext):
    key = "nobracket"

    ## Index of the key in alphabetic order
    n = len(key)
    key_index = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: key[i])

    ## Padding to make sure the size of pre_ciphertext
    ## is a multiple of the key's
    while len(pre_ciphertext)%n != 0:
        pre_ciphertext = pre_ciphertext + "X"

    ## Column reordering

    # permutation
    ciphertext = ""
    for i in range(len(pre_ciphertext)//n):
        for j in key_index:
            ciphertext = ciphertext + pre_ciphertext[i*n + j]

    # transposition
    true_cipher = ""
    for i in range(n):
        for j, c in enumerate(ciphertext):
            if j%n == i :
                true_cipher = true_cipher + c

    return true_cipher
        </code></pre>

        <code>part2</code> is made up of two major steps that I will call permutation and transposition. There is also a
        padding step before that, but this is irreversible as there is no way to know if the characters are padding or
        actually part of the message from the encrypted text alone. Luckily this doesn't matter much.

        <h3> Transposition </h3>

        Here is the code:

        <pre><code class="language-python">true_cipher = ""
for i in range(n): # outer
    for j, c in enumerate(ciphertext): # inner
        if j%n == i :
            true_cipher = true_cipher + c
        </code></pre>

        Lets start from the inner loop, we iterate over all the characters in <code>ciphertext</code> (along with their
        indices j), filter some out and append the rest to <code>true_cipher</code>. To understand the <code>j %
            n</code> part, we can imagine splitting the cipher text into many chunks of length n, we then only keep the
        elements which are the i<sup>th</sup> of their respective chunks:

        <div id="vis_transpose" class="vis clickable">
            <div class="meta_line">
                <div class="iter">n = </div>
                <div class="middle">ciphertext</div>
                <div class="info"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="line_1 line"></div>
            <div class="meta_line">
                true_cipher
            </div>
            <div class="line_2 line"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
            If we interpret the ciphertext as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order">row
                major</a> matrix (with rows of length n), this code effectively computes the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose">transpose</a> of this matrix, hence the name.
            <br />
            <br />
            As taking the transpose of the transpose of a matrix does nothing, the code to reverse the transposition
            would be the same as the one doing transposition with <code>n</code> replaced with <code>len(ciphertext) //
                n</code> (the transposed matrix's width).
        </div>

        Now that we have a good understanding of the process, we can start writing our <code>reverse_part2</code>
        function:

        <pre><code class="language-python">def reverse_part2(true_cipher):
    key = "nobracket"
    n = len(key)

    ciphertext = ""
    # number of chunks of length n in ciphertext
    m = len(true_cipher) // n
    # reconstruct each chunk one by one
    for i in range(m):
        # if ciphertext contained [a0, a1, a2, ..., b0, b1, b2, ...]
        #                    (i = 1)  0   1   2
        # then true_cipher contains [a0, b0, c0, ..., a1, b1, c1, ...]
        #                                 └─────── m ──────┘
        # So we start from i and skip m to get to the next one in the
        # chunk and do that for each chunk (the outer for)
        for j in range(i, len(true_cipher), m)
            ciphertext = ciphertext + true_cipher[j]
            </code></pre>

        <h3> Permutation </h3>

        At this point we are done with half of <code>part2</code> and we just need to reverse the permutation step
        before we can move on to <code>part1</code>. Here is the code:

        <pre><code class="language-python"># setup
key = "nobracket"
n = len(key)
key_index = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: key[i])

# permutation
ciphertext = ""
for i in range(len(pre_ciphertext)//n):
    for j in key_index:
        # index of the first character in the chunk ┐
        ciphertext = ciphertext + pre_ciphertext[(i * n) + j]
        #                              offset in the chunk ┘
            </code></pre>

        First the setup: most of it is around computing <code>key_index</code>, which is just a reordered
        <code>range(n)</code>. Then the loops, we again imagine splitting our input in consecutive chunks of length n,
        and iterate over the index i of each chunk. The inner loop simply adds all the characters of the chunk to
        ciphertext in the order prescribed by <code>key_index</code>. Effectively this permutates, or reorders the
        characters in every chunk.

        <div id="vis_permute" class="vis clickable">
            <div class="label">key index</div>
            <div class="cells cells_key_index"></div>
            <div class="label">chunk</div>
            <div class="cells cells_chunk"></div>
            <div class="label">reordered</div>
            <div class="cells cells_result"></div>
            <div class="label">key index reverse</div>
            <div class="cells cells_key_index_reverse"></div>
            <div class="label">reversed</div>
            <div class="cells cells_reversed"></div>
        </div>

        We can now reverse this and finish our <code>reverse_part2</code> function:
        <pre><code class="language-python">def reverse_part2(true_cipher):
    key = "nobracket"
    # key_index = [4, 2, 5, 7, 6, 0, 1, 3, 8] this means each reordered
    # chunk will have, in order, the 5th, 3rd, 6th, 8th, ..., characters.
    key_index = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: key[i])
    # compute the reverse permutation in the same way
    # this verrifies: key_index[key_index_reverse[i]] == i
    # key_index_reverse = [5, 6, 1, 7, 0, 2, 4, 3, 8]
    key_index_reverse = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: key_index[i])
    n = len(key)

    # reverse transposition
    ciphertext = ""
    # number of chunks of length n in ciphertext
    m = len(true_cipher) // n
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(i, len(true_cipher), m)
            ciphertext = ciphertext + true_cipher[j]

    # reverse permutation
    pre_ciphertext = ""
    for i in range(m):
        for j in key_index_reverse:
            pre_ciphertext = pre_ciphertext + ciphertext[i * n + j]

    return pre_ciphertext

            </code></pre>

        <h3> Testing </h3>

        At this stage we can run a little test to make sure we got it right, this way, if later we have a problem, we'll
        know to only look into <code>reverse_part1</code> since we made sure <code>reverse_part2</code> is right.

        <pre><code class="language-python"># length 18 since we don't reverse padding
test_input = "ADFGXAADDDFFFFXGXAA"
print(reverse_part2(part2(test_input)) == test_input)
            </code></pre>

        If this prints <code>True</code> we know we're good, if it doesn't, we need to debug.
